# Practice: Shopping at Big Jim's Country Store

## Overview:

*You'll write a Python script that:*
> - welcomes the user by name to the store
> - briefly explains to the user what the script will do
> - uses the `input()` function to prompt the user to enter the prices of five (5) items 
> - uses the `float()` function to convert the user's input to floats (numbers with a decimal point)
> - calculates and displays the **subtotal** (before taxes)
> - uses a **constant** of 6.00% for the Michigan sales tax rate
> - calculates and displays the **sales tax** for the order
> - calculates and displays in currency format the **grand total**
> - thanks the user for shopping at Big Jim's Country Store
